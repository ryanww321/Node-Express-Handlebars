# Node-Express-Handlebars

This is an app that allows you to input the types of burgers to be eaten.  Whenever a user submits what burger to be devoured it will be added to the list.  Each burger in the waiting area has a button to devour it.  The app will also store every burger in a database whether devoured or not.

The applications used to build this were MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.
